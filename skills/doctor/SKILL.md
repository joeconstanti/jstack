# doctor

Read `.agents/jstack/rules.md` first and apply it.

1. **Run** `python3 .agents/skills/doctor/scripts/doctor.py --project .` from
   the repository root. It checks jstack file integrity, discovery links,
   configured commands, tools and the SEO and Impeccable entrypoints.
2. **Compare** its report with README, project.json, lockfiles and the tool
   versions that project docs require.
3. **Dependencies.** For the SEO runtime, run the installed claude-seo launcher
   with `doctor --json`. Do not run Impeccable's doctor as a read-only check:
   it can repair state. Inspect its config and launcher instead.
4. **Repair only on request.** Name the smallest repair and its scope. Do not
   install global tools, change credentials, activate hooks, upgrade
   dependencies or start services to make the report green. After an
   authorized project-local repair, run the affected check again.

Report ready, missing, modified and unverified items apart. The script cannot
prove client reload, hook activation, runtime readiness, account access or app
health. Never print secrets.
