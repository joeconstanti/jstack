# review

Read `.agents/jstack/rules.md` first and apply it.

1. **Pin the target**: named artifacts, uncommitted changes, a commit range,
   branch against base (`git diff <base>...HEAD`) or a PR. For a diff, confirm
   the ref resolves and the diff is not empty. For an artifact, identify its
   version and audience; no Git diff is required. Find the intent (request,
   issue or PR body) and applicable project conventions.
2. **Read the whole artifact or diff**, plus enough relevant context and tests to
   judge behavior. For code, look where grep stops: generated output,
   redirects and headers, sitemap and robots, analytics IDs, deploy filters.
   For prose, trace material claims to sources, check logic and commitments.
   For design, compare with the brief and inspect the rendered artifact when
   available; distinguish observed defects from aesthetic preferences.
3. **Grade each finding.**
   - `blocker`: the intended case is wrong, or data, security, routes or
     deployment break, or the central claim/decision is unsupported.
   - `should`: a defect that affects users or readers inside the intent.
   Omit speculative concerns and items with no concrete impact or correction.
   Also flag scope creep: code, guards or tests that the intent does not need.
   Tag each finding `intent` (wrong or missing behavior) or `standards` (breaks
   a documented convention), so one kind does not hide the other.
4. **Report findings first**, by severity. Give each location, trigger, impact,
   supporting evidence and smallest fix in one concise paragraph unless the
   user requests another format. Omit routine scope and check summaries when
   findings alone are requested. Qualify evidence where it affects the finding.
   With no findings, say "no actionable findings", not "no bugs".

A review is not implementation and not merge approval.
